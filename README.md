## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm       | Characteristics                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort     | Simple, stable, O(n²), compares adjacent elements |
| Insertion Sort  | Builds the sorted list one element at a time |
| Selection Sort  | Finds the minimum and places it in order     |
| Merge Sort      | Divide and conquer, stable, O(n log n)       |
| Quick Sort      | Efficient in practice, average O(n log n)    |
| Heap Sort       | Uses a binary heap, O(n log n), not stable   |
